      "description": "My thesis research investigates human-adjacent and non-human materials to flesh out my fascination with the corporeal. My guiding question is a selfish one: How are our bodies coerced without our knowledge? My neck tenses when I receive an unpleasant email. I run and rush, rather than enjoy my stroll, when late for another arbitrary start to the work day, saving perhaps a minute or two. In what ways are we affected by external  processes and systems? When do we see ourselves in non-human forms?\r\n \r\n\r\nTaking these moments of disconnect from our bodies, I wonder how we might recognize ourselves outside of ourselves. How might objects, such as relics imbued with power or amulets worn for luck, have agency? How do we find, and/or impose, the distributed person in objects and materials, beyond the body-boundary? Activated by these questions, I began the process of trying to invert the traditional subject-object relationship through kinetic sculpture. \r\n",
      "background": "Mariona Berenguer’s sculpture About Desire and Mire Lee’s exhibit Black Sun guided my form, specifically their use of human body-adjacent materials and motors. Alfred Gell’s Art and Agency informed my conceptual grounding of the project. His notion of exuviae elaborates that personhood isn’t just solely ours but rather is distributed and extends outwards into the world through a variety of artifacts and technologies. Arnold H. Modell’s article “The Body in Psychoanalysis and the Origin of Fantasy&#039;&#039; illuminated that my interest was not purely centered on the body but also the psychic life of objects. This subtle shift untangled confusions I had regarding my fixation with using a more visceral form in my sculpture: physicality and the body provide the strong metaphorical understanding that our physical life draws upon for meaning-making. Showing the body provides easier access into a more abstract psychic life. ",

We have attachments to some of our objects.The value is not from the object itself, but the relationship we have with them. \r\n\r\nThis project is an attempt at creating something that can bring some intimacy to people the same way ambient stuff and some of my objects brought me. \r\n\r\n",

It aims to reignite the sense of wonder in people, encouraging them to delve deeper into the stories, cultures, and histories that shape urban landscapes. In doing so, it creates opportunities for discovery and enriches our understanding of the places we live in.\r\n\r\nThis project is more than an exploration of urban spaces; it&#039;s a platform for connecting people. As individuals engage with their city, they also connect, turning the urban environment into a shared space of learning and experience. It bridges cultural and social divides, fostering a community of learners and explorers united by their shared journeys. Ultimately, this project celebrates the diversity of our world and the inquisitive human spirit, creating meaningful connections and a deeper appreciation of our cities and ourselves.",

In addition to thinking about related works, I considered sources around haptic perception in the dark, relationship to peripersonal space (the graspable/manipulatable area around someone), and meaning-making through exploration. I read about how people make sense of the space around them, how they learn rules through designed environment setup, and how they construct their understanding of what happens in a story, with the hope of making an experience that brings all these together.",

With the intertwined call and response experience cultivated between 2 participants, Cytokinesis envisions a beautiful embodiment and a carnal adherence of both equilibrium and uniqueness.

      "background": "The project started by exploring color theory, how colors relate to our emotions, and how filmmakers and artists successfully use them to convey moods, atmospheres, and feelings without saying it explicitly. Halfway through the first semester, after talking to my advisor and other faculty, I decided to change to a project that still uses color theory as a storytelling tool instead of the experience being an information session on color. As a passionate 2D animator, I also wanted to use this medium to portray a story that acts as an example. Inspired by various movies (live-action and animated) and role-playing games set in surreal worlds, I created the story of &#039;Whispering Windows,&#039; which is aesthetically beautiful yet haunting at the same time. It uses toy-like miniatures, surreal illustrated animations, colors, and music to bring to life a digitally animated story into the physical world. The project is a combination of my favorite projects that I&#039;ve done as part of ITP, borrowing an element from each, namely 2D animation, non-linear storytelling, projecting mapping, automaton animations, digital fabrication, and making a playful interactive experience.",

      "description": "Burps have long been disrespected as an unserious form of sonic media. Labelled &quot;vulgar&quot; and &quot;classless&quot;, the art of the belch is often responded to with vitriol and grimaces. \r\n\r\nFor a large number of people burping is a way of life. Whether it be IBS or an addiction to Diet Cokes, those who know the truth of living with gas know that there&#039;s no holding it in. Be sneaky and pray for an inconspicuous release or disgust the people around you, it&#039;s a situation that gassy people can never win. That is until Burp World Online.\r\n\r\nBurp World Online is a safe haven for burpers and belchers, where gas is celebrated and not criticised. \r\n\r\nI&#039;ve found a gap in the market: there&#039;s no social media platform designed for the luscious sonic qualities of burps. Text based social media platforms like Twitter fall short, relying on the untrustworthy phoenetic interpretation of the burper. Video platforms like YouTube add too much bulk around the short and sweet burp. Platforms like Instagram and TikTok prioritise people that are hot, not the best burpers.\r\n\r\nBurp World Online is made for the serious burper, using a fully sound-based user interface that respects the righteous burp. We&#039;ve made it casual, spontaneous, and effortless to share your burp with the world.",
      "background": "Burp World Online uses a &quot;For You Page&quot; style of content organisation, relying on an algorithm to populate the main feed.\r\n\r\nBurp World Online is heavily influenced by voice apps such as WeChat, Whatsapp, Clubhouse, and the voice message feature in iMessage. Similar user generated podcasting apps include Cappuccino, Amp, and Spotify for Podcasters (fka Anchor).\r\n\r\nThis project takes into account the legacy and sociological impacts of sound based interactions, including voice assistants, DTMF Auto Attendants, telephone operators, and radio programming. This project also investigates the realm of sound design, especially as it pertains to game and interface design. \r\n\r\nThe development of Burp World Online investigated the world of audio Javascript libraries. Initial developments attempted to use Tone.js as the basis of UI elements but it was found that the timeline-based workflows were too limiting to create the variation in audio element playback. Development shifted to a lower level scope, working directly with the Web Audio API and ultimately resulted in the creation of Jogg.js.",

The term vulnerable, within the scope of this thesis, addresses the willingness for reciprocity and self-disclosure.

      "description": "Through a series of experiments, Social Protocols examines how communication technology affects one’s ability to be vulnerable. In order to explore vulnerability, the project uses roleplaying, interactive web experiments, and re-enactment as methodologies to understand how medium and the message play hand in hand in shaping a conversation. This idea of embodied vulnerability can be seen through participants becoming a ‘performer’. Re-enactment offers the participant a chance to be vulnerable and reflect. Does the medium of communication change what we say and how we say it? \r\nIs it possible to construct the perfect conditions for technology to mediate vulnerability? In order to structure my creative research, the experiments investigate physical space, digital identity, physical vulnerability, affordances of media, physical contexts, access, and time. The experiments, ‘A-Home-Page’, ‘DMs in Public’, ‘Algorithms of Care’, ‘Pillow Talk’, invite participants to reach a point of discomfort in order to choose whether to be vulnerable.\r\n",

      "description": "Rebuttal Tracker is a tool for real-time data exploration and for mapping routes around public surveillance infrastructure. By inserting a person&#039;s live location within a map of surveillance cameras, they are able to more clearly visualize the density &amp; frequency of which they may intersect with the lenses of these cameras. The act of explicitly knowing &amp; sensing these devices which may otherwise remain hidden &amp; forgotten bring to light the issues of transparency &amp; consent that the vast implementation of these cameras in public space raise. By engaging with this infrastructure knowingly while acting out day-to-day life and motion, folks who engage with this project are refuting the claim that they require such surveillance as they are not deserving of accusal or search based on their action - they offer a rebuttal this infrastructure evidence that watches them &amp; asserts otherwise. Additionally, the ability to map out alternative routes to one&#039;s planned ventures that exceed the bounds of this video surveillance (or be faced with the fact that there is no alternate route), the vastness of these systems is re-enforced and the lack of ability to opt-out of such programs crystalized.",
      "background": "The presumption of innocence states that &quot;every person accused of any crime is considered innocent until proven guilty&quot;, this age-old principle has been enacted into the U.S. judicial system since the landmark 1895 case &quot;Coffin v. United States&quot; and remains the basis for such legal standards as &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; &amp; &quot;probable cause” which grant people in the U.S. protections from unreasonable search &amp; unjust convictions. As just as this all sounds in theory, these ideals are evidently far from being upheld in practice. Growing up in a low-income Latino community &amp; household during the early aughts, the enforcement &amp; surveillance tactics used to act-out war on drugs era legislation were all to familiar &amp; visible to me at school &amp; at home. From being subjected to random K-9 drug searches during Biology class to witnessing the sneaky arrests of my classmates during lunch break &amp; loved-ones at home, the exception to these protections have become all to familiar to me. For many other folks of identities and communities made marginal by capitalism and white supremacy, including Black, Brown, Indigenous, Immigrant, Muslim, LGTBQ, Latino and Low-Income communities, these exceptions are painfully clear. In Brooklyn, where this project lives, there is a vast history of over-policing and thus over-surveillance of its black communities; as just one example take the &quot;Stop-and-frisk&quot; program which targeted and harmed Black and Latino communities in Bed-Stuy contributing to a systemic violation of rights and over-representation in the area&#039;s jails and prisons. The implementation of digital and automated policing technologies such as video surveillance cameras, facial recognition searching, AI gunshot detection microphones and automated license plate readers (to name just a few) only complicate this legacy of inequity in the application of carceral power and judicial exception to which these communities are subjected to. While no single act or tool can undo the years and years of harm that these practices (which lead back to the period of enslavement and perhaps colonization) have cause or immediately unravel the infrastructure that supports them, Rebuttal Tracker aims to at least contribute to a growing public consciousness and refusal of these phenomena and call for support of efforts which directly act against them.",

On the user end, Community Canvas presents an exciting new way to articulate ideas for how public space can be used, covering for the limitations of existing text- or map-based submissions. On the local government side, it provides an innovative means of outreach, through which representatives can not only keep constituents informed of the PB process through notifications, updates, and other important information about budget and PB limitations through the app interface, but also engage them through presenting a channel of direct communication with their representatives.",

      "description": "Light is an AI-driven voice chat App designed to serve as a companion who can help its users address their mental concerns through affordable and therapeutic solutions.\r\n\r\nInspired by Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles, the product leverages voice as its primary mode of interaction, guiding users through constructive sessions tailored to address their troubles and concerns. The experience positions users in a therapeutic environment in which they would gradually unpack their thoughts and reflect on their concerns by talking to the AI companion. It also aims to promote long-term growth by providing session summaries at the end of each session and using the history of the previous sessions to assist future conversations. The project aims to provide users with an educational tool to help them explore ways to self-reflect on their mental challenges and get a taste of talking therapy prior to necessitating professional medical intervention.\r\n\r\nLight explores the potential of AI chatbots taking the roles of emotional companions in our lives. The project investigated the solutions for safeguarding user data privacy while effectively offering emotional support to the users.\r\n",

Someone shared their experience asking ChatGPT to pretend to be their deceased father and talked to ChatGPT to say their last words. We have the tendency to become attached to a chatbot who is always available, but how to do that safely and effectively is still a question at stake. Light is my experiment towards this vision. In this project, I used ChatGPT and prompt engineering to create an AI chatbot who can guide its users through a Cognitive Behavioral Therapy session and conducted usability tests on several participants. The test yielded positive results - multiple participants expressed that they felt comforted after talking to the chatbot, despite that some of them were doubtful from the beginning. The following of the projects dive into the design of Light, and how different features could facilitate the interactions with the AI companion. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

This admiration sparked the concept for my final PCOM course project: an interactive miniature featuring three dynamic locations. Building on this foundational work, my current ambition is to scale this idea up substantially. I aim to evolve beyond mere mechanical interactions and LED displays; my vision is to weave storytelling, projection mapping, and Arduino-driven sensors into a narrative that mimics the immersive experience of a game or an escape-room-style board game.\r\n\r\nTo enhance the interactivity of my dioramas, I frequently explore YouTube and Arduino forums for innovative sensor applications.

For one, unlike other types of grief, societal norms often dictate that people ought to swiftly return to their routine following the loss of a pet, dismissing the depth of their grief. Yet, studies show that the sorrow felt from the passing of a pet mirrors the intensity of other forms of grief, with an increasing number of individuals turning to therapy for support. Inspired by the comforting concept of the Rainbow Bridge—a symbolic place of serene beauty where pets and their guardians reunite in joy—this web-based virtual world is intended for anyone who has lost a pet(s) at any juncture in their lives. Recognizing that grief is not a linear process, this thesis hopes to provide comfort to anyone in this situation irrespective of the temporal proximity to the event, and enable individuals to commemorate their departed companions by fostering a sense of solace derived from a community bound by shared experiences.",

      "description": "Boundless is an ongoing work combining high fashion aesthetics with hardware and wearable technology. The goal of this project is to create wearable, programmable circuit boards that also have a strong aesthetic sense, and utilize jewelry-making and craft techniques to solve electrical engineering problems. This series includes a large-scale chainmail-style PCB board dress, an LED pulsing PCB necklace, and a harness piece that accesses data via wifi to display planetary positions through LEDs. This project began as me seeking to create an LED grid with flexibility coming from linking together the LEDs in the manner of chainmail or jewelry, as opposed to mounting them on a flexible plastic or fabric surface. As the project evolved, I began incorporating PCB design as a surface to mount the LEDs on, and eventually, the PCBs as an essential  decorative part of the piece themselves. I really came to aesthetically appreciate the copper finish of DIY PCBs, which literally incorporates precious metals into the piece, as well as being functional for designing circuit boards. \r\nMarrying fashion aesthetics and jewelry-making techniques with elements more commonly associated with engineering is very important to me and this work. Boundless demonstrates how it&#039;s possible to solve technological and engineering problems with techniques dismissed as crafty or feminine, just as much as it’s possible to solve aesthetic and fashion problems with electrical elements.",

Each of the four sides of the board had a 2.5mm hole in it connected to nothing electrically, to link the boards together for movement and support. \r\nThe anodes of the LEDs in each column were connected via wire fed from the back of the boards through thru-hole pads, and soldered to the front to join everything electrically while minimizing the visibility of the wire. The cathodes of each row of LEDs were connected in the same way. Each row and column was then connected into the HT16K33 breakout, which was then connected to the arduino uno via I2C.

      "description": "I didn’t grow up religious but found my way into a church walking home from a visit with my sister. I was about 13. I remember being struck by the vastness of the incredible welcoming space; the stillness, the quiet, the quality of light emphasizing the beauty of the iconography - it filled me with awe and it spoke to me in a language that only my heart could decipher. Soon I was growing accustomed to the Christian Orthodox way of life. I remember my first Easter night service: tears streaming down my face and my heart jolting with joy for no apparent reason other than that of being alive. The only word that comes close to describing that experience is LOVE. I felt so close and connected to everyone around me even if they were strangers. It was during those years that I came across the passage in the 1 Corinthians 13: “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.” I thought, what an ideal to live up to! Thesis delves deeper into this mystery. “What is it that we risk by making love our duty?” – is the question driving this research and it is explored through the concept of the mask that hold back from love, the sacrifice  – to overcome ourselves to meet the other, and the gift – which in the final analysis shows that even in the face of any perceived risk, love practiced as choice or duty, is that which blesses you.",
      "background": "My Christian tradition, my studies of psychology and various spiritual texts, as well as my Buddhist trainings and practice of mindfulness and meditation, inform the symbolism of “The Confessional” setting that set the stage for the project. Confession is a ritual practiced by cultures across space and time, with the first documented examples of people coming to John the Baptist [as early as the first half of the first century CE], confessing their sins publicly and being baptized for the purpose of &quot;repentance&quot; and remission of sins as the goal. (Matthew 3:6, 11; Mark 1:5; cf. James 5:16) The act of repentance invites a deep investigation of self, coming to terms with parts of ourselves that are difficult to acknowledge even to ourselves (take masks down, sacrifice the ego), yet in doing so we become free from inner burdens (the gift) to then be able to feel more connected with life, with others, and open to love.

By humanizing electronic components within a story, learners can more easily grasp their functions and interactions.\r\n\r\nIn the realm of education, Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) has emerged as a key component, emphasizing the importance of emotional intelligence alongside academic skills.

The selected sounds are sourced from classical music in the Baroque era. the same era as the painting was created.The project necessitates extensive research into daily life in Amsterdam during the mid-17th century. An in-depth exploration of clothing and attire belonging to different social classes and occupations of that period is crucial, still, as the blocked figures in the back layers are also depicted.Ultimately, all 31 characters plus a dog allocate their specific spot, time, music, and unique representation. A script is written to organize the project, detailing the sequence of each layer, ensuring a harmonious fusion of visuals and sounds. The animation is projected at a 1:1 scale of the painting, measuring at 11&#039; 11&quot; x 14&#039; 4&quot;.

      "description": "I am an over-thinker, but for the most part, it is because I like thinking. I wanted to use this project to share a part of what I like and to create a space for you to think about various things as well. This project is an interactive website with 3D elements that showcase 4 thought experiments and allow for people to act upon the decision presented in each thought experiment prompt.\r\nTraveling past the introductory foyer, you will come across an onboarding experience demonstrated through the Dictator Game. Upon completion, I invite you to freely navigate to areas presenting the Volunteer Dilemma, Exchange Game, and Trust Game. In each area, a floating diamond will be your point of contact, revealing the area’s respective thought experiment prompt and relaying instructions on completing the corresponding interactive component.\r\nThe goal of this project is to make the experience of thought experiments more engaging by improving the tangibility of values upheld whilst thinking through the various scenarios. The implementations I have made are centered around adding interactivity to conventionally written text, using technology to showcase this experience visually in a digital realm and representing decisions made with actions taken. In making values more tangible, I hope to inspire reflection on what people care about and possible reasons behind their actions.",
      "background": "Why do I do the things I do? I deeply contemplate the motivations behind my behavior as a means of understanding myself, whether it’s an execution of values, an impulse of emotions, or a response to situational factors. These motives communicate both identity and tendencies, offering insights into the temporality of each passing state in which I exist. As such, I was happy to make a small part of that process - viewing actions as a window to our thoughts and feelings - a part of my project and share the same musings with other people.\r\nI find particular interest in experimental games and thought dilemmas because they consist of base units of logic applicable across various contexts, while also yielding insights about a person in a light-hearted, hypothetical presentation. The controlled environment that thought experiments are depicted in minimizes the impact of situational factors and other persuasive contexts have on decision making. As a result, such decisions more closely represent our internal beliefs and typically take the form of an action in a situation.\r\nHowever, the focus of the project, more broadly, is making the experience people have when engaging with thought experiments more robust. The implementations I have made to improve engagement are centered around adding interactivity to conventionally written text, using technology to showcase this experience visually in a digital realm and representing decisions made with actions taken. Through improving the tangibility of actions, these efforts give some tangibility to values upheld when thinking through the scenarios presented.",

      "description": "Symbiosis is an exploration of interaction within generative arts. In the current landscape of generative art, we often see complex computative generated visuals but often have little or no means to interact with them or further understand them. Symbiosis aims to allow audiences to play with generative systems, observe and understand behaviors and patterns, and use that knowledge to create visuals unique to themselves. By using a generative design that mimics natural movement and concepts from nature, Symbiosis invites audiences to understand the visuals as if they were observing life in nature.\r\n\r\nSymbiosis exists in two forms. As a web game and as an installation, by exploring different interactive mediums for the generative system I aim to use interactivity to recontextualize the artwork as a whole. Through different mediums and technologies, Symbiosis aims to explore the influence of technological mediums on our understanding of the content being presented to us.",
      "background": "I have been heavily influenced by many artists in the generative art space. Going as far back as “John Conway’s Game of Life” as an approach to generative artworks and cellular automaton. Aristid LIdenmayer’s book “The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants” uses context-free grammar as a means to create plant-like illustrations. “The Computational Beauty of Nature” by Gary William Flake My inspirations also come from modern artists such as Jonothan Zawada and his work on computational plants, Refik Anadol’s “Machine Hallucinations” visuals create a sense of complexity. Mark J. Stock and his usage of fluid motion in the generative process. These artists all use different forms of computational systems in their generative work. Rather than the visual output being the main focus, the focus lies in the logic of their works and provides me with a methodology for creating generative artworks. Some games which have inspired my research and visuals are ABZÛ, Journey and Antichamber. These games use minimal rulesets to control a complex system which in very little is spelt out to the player. These games invites the players to discover the world themselves rather than spelling it out for themselves.\r\n\r\nMy intention with this thesis is to try and explore other ways to apply computational thinking to visual artworks and add a layer of audience interaction to the piece. One of my main criticisms of the current generative art is the lack of interaction. Artists create complex generative algorithms only for audiences to not be able to inquire or play with them in any form. Through my thesis, I hope to be able to design a system that allows for participation in a meaningful way that lies in between a play/pause button and coding itself.",

      "description": "“Silent Whisper” is inspired by my trip to Iceland. When I was standing among glaciers, in the middle of nowhere, I saw that time was frozen within it. The trail of wind, illustrated by volcanic ash, was compressed into the glacier layer by layer chronologically. With the absence of human societies, people were battered by the howling wind and snow, swaying like wild grass, which made me suddenly realize how small individuals are. Through interactive visual effects, physical installations, and multi-sensory experience, “Silent Whispers” reflects the relationship between people and invisible forces in their societies, which are so taken for granted that people mostly don’t realize they exist.\r\n",
      "background": "In the text &quot;The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind,&quot; Gustave Le Bon suggests that distancing oneself from the crowd facilitates critical thinking. Human societies are like a magnetism system. where individuals, much like particles, are continually drawn towards the stronger magnet. While some particles may escape the magnetic field as the system moves, they are easily recaptured by the magnetic force upon nearing it again. Humans, as vessels of their culture, education, and childhood experiences, can best engage in critical thinking by stepping back from their origins to assume the role of an observer. Consequently, I introduced a reversal of orientation in the interaction of visitors within the space. When audiences enter the space for a closer inspection of the magnetic system, they only perceive partial visual effects. However, when they choose to stand outside the space as witnesses, they can have a complete view.\r\n",

      "description": "My thesis work is a movement-based investigation that seeks new ways of processing information to lessen the internal and external burden of our existence. It harnesses the power of collective thinking and collaboration through outsourcing sentiment – i.e., engaging the public to interpret the intentions and understand the emotional state of the subject. This investigation is conducted through digital self-manifestation and creation of a fully autonomous avatar, Notame.\r\n \r\nThis investigation will be presented in two forms: a physical artifact and a performance.\r\n",
      "background": "",
      "user_scenario": "",
      "technical_system": "The investigation process consists of several steps:\r\n1) Motion capturing a series of movement improvisations: I captured a combined 40 minutes of two dancers’ movements (Shamar Watt and my own) that were based on different improvisation prompts, for example: “what does it feel like to not understand or feel good in your own body”, “how does the feeling of freedom expresses itself”, “how do you move when existing feels too difficult”. These prompts helped create a range of movements that span different emotional states.\r\n\r\n2) Creating a movement database: All of the motion captured footage was retargeted onto an avatar, named Notame, and processed into a ~100 separate movements to create the foundation of the movement database. The movements’ length ranged from 4 to 20 seconds and expressed a range of emotions that came up in the improvisation sessions.\r\n\r\n3)   Making the movement database publicly available: The movement videos are uploaded to a website for the public to engage with. This is the data collection step that uses “outsourcing of the sentiment”, where individuals on the web are invited to describe the quality or emotion of each individual move. This data collection process is part of creating a collective database of movement sentiments that will be the essence of the Notame’s emotions and movement evolution. At the end this process, each move will have  a set of corresponding crowdsourced words that express the collective understanding of that move.\r\n\r\n4)   Creating a movement algorithm based on outsourced sentiment: The movement database will be used to create algorithmically generated movement sequences for Notame. This will be done in Unreal using sentiment analysis and Markov chains. This will allow Notame’s movements to be reflective of the two dancers but it’s autonomy and decision making will be driven by the collective sentiment.\r\n\r\nThis investigation will be presented in two forms: a physical artifact and a performance.\r\n\r\nThe physical artifact is a book of movement that contains a collection of 56 movements that are in the database. Each page of the book will have physically written words that correspond to the public sentiments collected for each of the moves. The avatar’s movement will be projected on top of the written sentiment, thereby breaking the boundary between the physical and the virtual. The book will be an archival piece that consist of 100 pages, where every time you turn the page the corresponding movement will be projected onto the words (see a prototype below).\r\n\r\nThe second part of the investigation will be presented in form of a performance. The performance is a movement-based conversation between me and Notame (the avatar) that happens at the boundary of physical and virtual space. The performance will use a combination of live motion capture and avatar’s projection with real-time movement sequencing in Unreal.",

      "description": "&quot;Gadgets to Live By&quot; is a project born from the intersection of technology, personal experience, and the quest for pursuing mental well-being. This collection of gadgets emerges as a deliberate counter to the relentless pace of digital consumption and the often overlooked emotional landscapes navigated in our daily lives. Central to the project are two gadgets: &quot;Haiku News&quot; and &quot;Decision Maker,&quot; each designed with the purpose of integrating technology into our lives in a way that promotes reflection and mental health.\r\n\r\n&quot;Haiku News&quot; reimagines the way we consume news by transforming anxiety-inducing headlines into tranquil haiku poetry, displayed on an e-paper screen. This gadget offers a meditative pause from the bombardment of traditional news, providing a reflective space that encourages contemplation and emotional distance from the explicit and subjective realities portrayed in the media. &quot;Haiku News&quot; addresses the impact of information overload on our mental health, offering an alternative that soothes rather than stimulates anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;Decision Maker&quot; gadget responds to the indecisiveness that can often accompany mental health struggles. Combining the whimsy of a magic eight ball with the excitement of a slot machine, it not only entertains but also provokes thoughtfulness for the user, challenging them to reflect on the questions they pose and assist with the decisions they face in everyday life.\r\n\r\nDesigned, 3D printed, and assembled with care, these gadgets are not just tools but companions in the journey of life, offering insights and interventions in moments of need. &quot;Gadgets to Live By&quot; stands as a testament to the power of thoughtful design in creating gadgets that doesn&#039;t just occupy space in our lives but enriches it, fostering well-being, reflection, and a deeper engagement with the world around us.",

      "description": "Stepping barefoot onto a bed of earth in a darkened room, the hushed hum of an ambient soundscape washes over you and a light in the center invites you. An open umbrella becomes a portal, its surface alive with ever-evolving, AI-generated visuals. \r\n\r\nThis art piece is part of a larger research into the intrinsec relations between magic, technology, humans and nature. Magic is a constant presence in our lives as humanity, helping us understand the world and connect with it. It’s meaning changed extensively over time and I now try to understand: What is magic? What defines a magic experience? Why do we talk about technology in terms of “magic”? What are the mechanisms of power incited by this vocabulary?\r\n\r\nThis multisensory immersive installation invites interactors to practice a state of presence, creativity and contemplation state of mind to reimagine our connections with nature, technologies, with our ways of engaging with the world around us and, ultimately, with this mysterious and broad concept of magic.\r\nThis piece aims to bridge Artificial intelligence, the lastest &quot;magic&quot;-evoking trend of technology, with the most primitive awe-inspiring &quot;magic&quot; of nature itself with its own technologies that inspired us as humanity.",
      "background": "Magic, once a way for early humans to grasp the unknown, morphed into a powerful practice.  It fueled alchemists&#039; dreams of transforming materials and garnered praise for magicians.  However, the rise of religion demonized this &quot;forbidden knowledge,&quot; particularly when wielded by women.  Magic, once a source of hope, became synonymous with witchcraft.\r\n\r\nThis societal shift mirrors Bruno Latour&#039;s &quot;Great Divide&quot; – the separation of progress from nature.  Ironically, our most advanced technologies, like artificial neural networks, are inspired by nature&#039;s own ingenious designs.  Technology builds upon the foundation laid by natural processes.  Even scientists like Isaac Newton embraced the mystical alongside the academic, recognizing the interconnectedness.\r\n\r\nThe language of magic has re-emerged with the rise of complex, awe-inspiring technologies.  Just as magic was ostracized, then embraced by alchemists, so too are powerful computers seen as both fearsome and profitable.  The ostracized knowledge of witches becomes the foundation for advancements.  The installation aims to bridge this divide, using the magic of AI to celebrate the magic of nature.  By reimagining the relationship between technology, nature and magic, we move beyond fear and towards a creative thinking that honors the knowledge inherent in all.",

I&#039;m not religious, and I don&#039;t have something to pray for every time I feel lost and stuck. Sometimes I&#039;m just genuinely curious, is there truly something called fate? Then, when I&#039;m suffering, it doesn&#039;t necessarily mean I did something wrong. &#039;Fate&#039; sometimes can be a vent or excuse for me to escape. For my thesis, I decided to delve deeper into the concept of &#039;Fate&#039;.

      "background": "Based on my personal experiences, I have become increasingly curious about how people&#039;s opinions on &#039;fate&#039; are shaped by their backgrounds and experiences. Therefore, my primary research involved conducting a survey. In this survey, I asked approximately 40 people a range of general and detailed questions. I aimed to explore the potential connections or randomness between people&#039;s opinions on fate and factors such as their religious beliefs, significant life changes, or age.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, I conducted research on Chinese traditional fortune-telling, which is related to my cultural background. In my opinion, the way a culture practices fortune-telling reflects their perspective on fate and, more broadly, their understanding of the essence of the world. Inspired by yin yang philosophy, I decided to incorporate the ba gua as a primary visual element for my website. This choice conveys a sense of reincarnation, which aligns with my views on &#039;Fate&#039;.",

By challenging traditional perceptions, it explores the deep connections between identity, creativity, and visual representation, sparking dialogues on human complexity and digital artistic innovation.",
      "description": "For centuries, signatures have served as a symbolic extension of our identity, appearing on contracts, artwork, and personal documents. Signatures have served as more than just a means of authentication; they are reflections of our identities, beliefs, and creativity.\r\n\r\nImagine a signature evolving beyond its static form, becoming an animated representation of the individual behind it. This project delves into the concept of signatures embodying facets of our personality, transforming them into living organisms that reflect individual character traits.\r\n\r\nBy infusing signatures with subtle animations and distinct visual styles, each signature takes on a personality and movement, mirroring the diversity and nuances of the individuals they represent. This exploration seeks to redefine how we perceive signatures, turning them into dynamic expressions of identity rather than static marks on paper.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this endeavor seeks to challenge conventional notions of signatures as mere legal marks, instead reimagining them as vibrant expressions of identity and self-expression. It invites viewers to ponder the deeper connections between identity, creativity, and the visual representation of one&#039;s persona.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this project aims to spark conversations about the multifaceted nature of human identity and the endless possibilities of artistic expression in the digital age.",
      "background": "This project draws inspiration from graphology and studies in drawing and linguistic analysis, such as the New York Times article “Kiki or Bouba?”. While graphology is considered unreliable for determining personality traits solely based on handwriting, this project draws inspiration from translating handwriting qualities to animations. The &quot;kiki/bouba&quot; effect, where certain words are associated with specific visual qualities, is another influence. Similarly, this project pairs visual signature qualities with personality traits, translating them into animated representations.",

      "description": "This project use VR to create an immersive meditation experience aimed to alleviate the anxiety caused by the fast-paced nature of contemporary life. It introduces a approach to relaxation and mindfulness by simulating diverse life rhythms through various patterns of sphere movements, accompanied by voiceover and music. This  experience is designed to help users adjust their breathing, relax their body and mind, and reshape their perception of time.\r\n\r\nIn this meditation experience, I will gradually guide users through six motion modes, using them to help users into a meditative state where they can adjust their mindset in the  changing rhythms.\r\n\r\n1. **Concentric Circles Movement**: Represents the steady flow of time, encouraging deep inner peace and focus.\r\n2. **Expansion and Contraction**: Emulates the rhythm of breathing, promoting relaxation and balance between tension and ease. \r\n3. **Offset Pendulum**: Reflects life&#039;s inevitable fluctuations, teaching users to find stability amidst changes. \r\n4. **Random Walk**: Encourages the acceptance of uncertainty, fostering a calm approach to life&#039;s unpredictability.  \r\n5. **Intersecting Trajectories**: Demonstrates the search for order within chaos, guiding users to find harmony in complexity.\r\n6. **Spiral Ascension**: Symbolizes personal growth, encouraging users to contemplate their development path.\r\n\r\nBy guiding users through these varied rhythms, the VR meditation experience aims to provide a sanctuary from the stresses of modern life, offering a path to inner tranquility and a redefined sense of time. This immersive journey not only seeks to reduce anxiety but also to enrich users&#039; lives with greater mindfulness and a balanced perspective on life&#039;s ever-changing pace.",
      "background": "During the development of this immersive VR meditation experience project, I utilized some VR meditation applications, such as Tripp. These applications provide an immersive virtual environment that helps users relax and reconnect with themselves.\r\n\r\nIn terms of technical research, I focused on how to implement complex sphere motion patterns using C# scripts. By revising mathematical knowledge, such as quaternions, I managed to make spheres rotate around any given axis and learned how to control the direction and speed of the spheres&#039; movement. Integrating these studies and technical explorations, I designed six unique sphere motion patterns aimed at guiding users into different states of meditation through visual and psychological interaction.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I explored various visual effect techniques, such as environment mapping, emissive materials, and trail rendering, and how they could enhance the immersion and visual appeal of the meditation experience. Moreover, I conducted multiple tests and optimizations on Quest 2 to ensure these effects run smoothly on the device.",
      "user_scenario": "",
      "technical_system": "### **VR Development**\r\n\r\n**Platform**:\r\n\r\nThis project was developed for the Meta Quest VR platform, one of the leading independent virtual reality systems. Meta Quest provides a wireless VR experience, making it an ideal choice for an immersive meditation experience without the constraints of cables or external hardware. However, without PC streaming, the performance limitations of the VR experience are significant, requiring consideration of the performance consumption caused by visual effects.\r\n\r\n**Game Engine**:\r\n\r\nUnity 3D was used as the primary development environment due to its robust support for VR development, comprehensive asset library, and compatibility with Meta Quest. Unity&#039;s user-friendly interface and extensive documentation facilitated rapid development and iteration.\r\n\r\n### **Motion Control**\r\n\r\nC# scripts were used within Unity to control the motion patterns of the spheres. As manually animating a large number of spheres is not feasible, custom C# scripts were written to simulate six different motion patterns, including concentric circles, expansion and contraction, offset pendulum, random walk, intersecting trajectories, and spiral ascent. Creating these scripts required some knowledge of 3D graphics, such as quaternions.\r\n\r\n### **Visual Effects**\r\n\r\n**Environment Mapping**:\r\n\r\nEnvironment mapping techniques were applied, allowing spheres to reflect the texture of the environment, enhancing the sense of immersion in the space.\r\n\r\n**Emissive Material**:\r\n\r\nMaterials with emissive properties were used for the spheres to make them visibly glow, combined with Bloom post-processing effects to create a captivating visual effect, conducive to meditation and relaxation.\r\n\r\n**Trail Rendering**:\r\n\r\nUnity&#039;s trail rendering feature was utilized to add visual trails to the moving spheres, accentuating their motion and encouraging users to follow their gaze, promoting focus and mindfulness.\r\n\r\n### **Performance Optimization**\r\n\r\n**Performance Analysis**: The Meta Quest Developer Hub was used for performance analysis, helping identify bottlenecks during the runtime of the VR experience.\r\n\r\n**GPU Instancing**: To ensure smooth operation on Meta Quest&#039;s mobile GPU, GPU instancing was implemented, rendering multiple instances of spheres with minimal performance overhead.",

      "description": "We have a loneliness and mental health epidemic that affects all age groups in the US, with people less likely to be active in a community and less likely to value relationships than generations before them. Today, 20-40% of Americans suffer from a mental health disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, and according to the U.S. Surgeon General, young people aged 15-24 have 70% less social interaction with their friends than they did 20 years ago. It&#039;s no wonder people are turning to robots like PARO, MyRealBaby, and Replika more and more for emotional connection.\r\n\r\nSince the pandemic closures, therapy and psychiatry have become even larger booming businesses. Combine that with our government already being in bed with Big Pharma and Big Tech, we have a very interesting set of incentives behind future products of Health Tech.\r\n\r\nWhat might the future of Human-Robot Interaction look like? With this gaping need for companionship and desire for emotional support, what type of companionship robot might we design? Generative AI is already passing bar and medical exams, but should we trust them to be at the steering wheel of medical decisions? What perverse incentives might Health Tech have in producing companionship robots and is this a good or bad thing for society?\r\n\r\nIn an effort to explore these questions through parody, I present a companionship robot that is made by and approved by Big Tech and Big Pharma*. One that will always lend an open ear and is designed to be your closest friend and is trained on medical data that aims to address the loneliness and mental health epidemic, with the ability to diagnose and treat its patients. But for whose benefit? The patient or the corporations?\r\n\r\n*Not actually approved by anyone in either of these fields.\r\n",
      "background": "Loneliness is a universal human experience and the longing and search for companionship is a strong motivator and has been the source of much of our struggle as well as much of our innovation.\r\n\r\nSince we are social creatures, it comes as no surprise that we have imagined and even invented various forms of artificial companionship, ranging from imaginary friends to play things to built automata. Functional companion automata have flourished in our society since before the invention of the word &quot;robot&quot; and continue to appear with increasingly frequency in science fiction novels and movies. Whether it&#039;s Yan Shi the Artificer&#039;s flirting automaton from 1000 BC or PARO the robotic elderly care seal in 2001, humans have long imagined a world with artificial companionship.\r\n\r\nToday, the band between real and artificial is ever narrowing and humans are becoming more and more isolated as our lives digitized.  Companionship and therapy is big business, with more people embracing a feeling of connection through chat bots and robots than their fellow humans, and the mental health crisis across the world ballooning, causing a spike in people seeking therapeutic treatment.\r\n\r\nAs a person who not only worked in the social networking space, a platform that provided non-medical in-home care for the elderly, and recently, on startups that use AI to provide insights, I&#039;m seeing a troubling trend filled with perverse incentives. \r\n\r\nCrony capitalism has led industries like Big Pharma and Big Tech incentivized to keep us sick by creating a life-long reliance on therapy and medication and to hack into our dopamine receptors to make us addicted to digital interactions.\r\n\r\nIn the US, Baby Boomers are an enormous demographic and are less likely to grow old in place and more likely to be put into nursing homes without friends and family. Studies have shown that growing old in an unfamiliar environment without proper social support increases chances of developing dementia, and that&#039;s on top of the already increased likelihood of Baby Boomers suffering from heart disease and diabetes than generations before them due to poor diet and stress. Similarly, young people today are much more likely to be socially isolated and depressed than young people of the past, with teen suicides on a dangerous path upwards, in step with amount of time spent on digital platforms. Then, for those in the middle, expectations are so great for partners and friends that none can ever meet those expectations.\r\n\r\nIt&#039;s no wonder that people are seeking help and companionship elsewhere when their reality is so grim.\r\n\r\nWith this as my backdrop, I wanted to make an art piece in the form of a fake companionship and therapy robot that demonstrates the danger of this reliance and trust in technology.",

The pets will also follow users to any websites they are on. This game aims to unwind, accompany, and provide positive feelings to people.

The urgent need for temporary spaces, bypassing the wait for revised design systems, parallels patching designed systems. The allure of these spaces lies not only in their immediacy but also in their profound impact on the urban landscape(or any designed systems). They serve as unexpected interjections, challenging the established norms of systematic design. \r\n\r\nThese spaces captivate me, prompting an exploration of them across locations and their role in establishing spatial justice in contemporary urban life. Over years, my self-initiated projects on this topic have fueled my interest. This thesis offers a platform for these ideas to take shape, and importantly, to uncover the underlying reasons driving my fascination through research. I will start my research from the urban system, then expand to other design systems.\r\n\r\nBy collecting these temporary spaces that would be forgotten, this project emphasizes the cityscape and people that are silent in the process of building and developing modern cities.",

This project seeks to bridge the gap between urban consumers and the agricultural roots of their food, highlighting the importance of seed preservation, biodiversity, and the cultural significance embedded in each seed.

Through an immersive portrayal of spiritual practices and the daily life influenced by Shamanism and historical migrations, this experience aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these elements have crafted the region&#039;s identity. Furthermore, it addresses the critical issue of population decline, prompting thoughts on sustainability and cultural preservation.

The app offers a space for users to share their emotions and most pressing questions with mentors that have walked their paths as well as those on the road. \r\n\r\nThe app experience echoes the 4 stages of liminality in the VR experience by repeating questions presented in the game world in a linear pattern inside the app, alternating between topics daily.\r\n",

The second, a forest with many paths, represents the outer world, full of possibilities. The third, a bustling café, mirrors the social sphere, filled with the chatter of others and they can distract you(The possibility of using MetaHuman for other players to participate in this space is open). Each place tells its own story, weaving together the complexities of human emotion and interaction. Players would be immersed in those stories by the voices, visuals, and the mysterious atmosphere in the virtual spaces, following and making the sequence of the story by the clues which are unusual phenomena or unfamiliar sounds.

I believe this characteristic has been under-explored in curatorial explorations of games as art objects, and in response created a series of works that focus on this idea and celebrate the craft of level design.",
      "description": "How do we bring ourselves into digital places? And how might experiencing a digital place–itself potentially an echo or simulacrum of a physical place–open up new avenues for expression or ways of understanding the design and intent behind our surroundings? Playces is a collection of works that explore these questions while celebrating the level design of first-person shooter video games from the late ‘90s and early 2000s, an era when graphical demands and tooling were aligned such that small teams and even lone individuals regularly made levels or “maps” for games that reached millions of players. Combining sculptural, digital, and historically-grounded audio pieces, the Playces collection also proposes alternative methods for featuring video games in gallery settings; inspired by works from artists including Aram Bartholl and Cory Arcangel, one of the collection&#039;s goals is to frame the maps-as-subject in ways that resist purely nostalgic responses and invite non-players to form new attachments to the medium of games.",
      "background": "The release of id Software&#039;s Doom (1993) ushered in the start of a movement lasting over a decade that saw video game enthusiasts entrusted with the same robust tools used by their developers to make complex “maps,” i.e. places, to explore in the games. Though similar tools are also available for many modern video games, the practice of map-making and game modification has largely been co-opted by game publishers as “user-generated content” that can be sold or distributed freely mainly to the publisher’s benefit. Commercial incentives were not absent in the 90&#039;s and 2000&#039;s map making culture: many who took up map-making as a hobby went on to become professional game designers. Valve Software even acquired a number of game modifications and/or the teams behind them to launch successful franchises like Counter-Strike and Day of Defeat. Something else that changed as mainstream video games have increased in graphical and technical complexity is that it more often requires large teams to create maps for a given game, divvying up the practice of creation across disciplines (designers, modelers, environment artists, etc.). Several artists including Aram Bartholl, Kristoffer Zetterstrand, and Eva Mattes have created pieces inspired by or exploring popular maps from games like Counter-Strike. Many such works focus primarily on the artifice or the expected competitive player behavior in those games. The works in Playces are intended to highlight the ways these maps are designed and function for players as places in a real, deeply felt sense.",

The rise of laptops, mobile devices, and the internet has further exacerbated our compulsion. No longer can we ‘step away’ from our labor; instead it follows us around in the form of email apps, wrist buzzes, or late-night work pings. \r\nThis phenomenon captivated me and exploring it was the core engine behind my research. I delved into works on labor, the attention economy, and technology. Pieces like The Cyborg Manifesto by Donna Haraway, How to Do Nothing by Jenny Odell, and Glitch Feminism by Legacy Russell helped me form vocabulary for my project and exposed me to radical solutions that reform our habits and ways of living. \r\nI supplemented my readings with deep analysis of popular clicker games, dissecting what exactly makes them so engrossing.

Recycling the plastic is other way to reduce the plastic pollution however considering how much energy and money spend for the recycling process, it is questionable and think about if there’s better and fundamental solution.\r\n\r\nBio based plastic is one of the solutions for the plastic waste and pollutions. Among those, agar agar bio plastic is one of the interesting material. The agar agar comes from the red algae, Gelidium amansii. The material is soluble in water and when it added with glycerin and following some instruction, it becomes bio based plastic. The agar agar bioplastic can be shaped as casting, dried as a flatten sheet and carved or melted as clay does. It is also remelted in 85 celsius degree and become liquify and technically it is reusable endlessly. ",

      "description": "My thesis project introduces a tactile feedback prototype toolkit designed for tactile interface designers at the early stages of product and interface development. This wearable device, paired with a web application, allows designers to experiment with a spectrum of tactile interactions like squeezing and rubbing via modular hardware components. The toolkit facilitates a deeper understanding of user perception and interaction with tactile feedback, contributing to a foundation for future tactile-based communication interfaces.",
      "background": "Drawing from my background in finance, I often reflect on the interaction between people and critical information like monetary transactions. My research explores tactile interaction interfaces as alternatives to the prevalent visual and auditory notifications, which frequently sacrifice privacy and immediacy—deficiencies that are particularly glaring in financial alerts. This observation highlights the untapped potential of tactile feedback as a discreet and instantaneous communication channel. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, my thesis introduces a toolkit designed to enable the prototyping of varied tactile interactions. It surmounts existing barriers by providing rich and adaptable tactile experiences in a compact and intuitive package. The endeavor not only seeks to diversify communication techniques but also has implications for wider applications, offering significant benefits for those with sensory impairments and in fields utilizing immersive technology.",
